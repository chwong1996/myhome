Lots of people have lots of goals; and lots of people have lots of goals that don't actually accomplish in their lives. I have my own little notebook I carry along with me all the time, yet I just can't seem to find the urge to do it like <b>NOW</b>. Joel Runyon created the world's <a href="https://impossiblehq.com/the-impossible-list-is-not-a-bucket-list/" target="_blank"><i>first impossible list</i></a>.
