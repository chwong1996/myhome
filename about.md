<h1>About this website... first</h1>

I first learnt how to build a website (well basic html stuff when back in the days you were forced to take Computer lessons) when I was 13 and I resent it so much I have never thought about touching anything that's related to programming again. In Summer 2016 I read an article about promoting myself; and in this day and age what's better than using the internet? Look at how the United Airlines promoted its customer services!
So, I decided to pick it up again, and viola! There ya go!

<h1>Now... Let's talk about myself </h1>

I'm currently studying in the University of Southampton, doing my third year in civil engineering. I'm an adventurous human being who loves to explore and I love to challenge myself. I like to find my weaknesses and try to overcome them; that is part of the reason why I took up American Football, one of the most violent contact sports in the world; and the major reason for me to pick up programming again. 



My friends define who I am, and luckily I have been influenced by very motivated friends who keep driving me forward and improving myself; so here I would like to express my gratitude to Tunde, Dubai, Ademola and Adib; without them I would never be the same.
