Ever not able to wake up for 12pm lecture? Ever want to wake up to a good morning with music and sun?

Coupled with the automatic Spotify Python script, the idea is when the alarm goes off, sun shines into the window and music plays to wake you up. 

Entire model held by nothing but sellotape and blu-tack, made with household materials and an arduino. This is the crudest yet the most effective machine to wake you up!

Guarenteened to wake you up for the first two days, effect enhances when the postman looks inside the window and see your lazy ass sleeping.
