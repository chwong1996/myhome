Technology is critical for innovation, and innovation is how people, or even the whole human mankind moves forward.  

So after making the automatic curtain opener, what can I do to make something for myself?

A robotic arm. Ta-DA! Fully customizable! The best thing about the robotic arm, with the Arduino is that I can make it do whatever I want, whenever I want!

This robot runs on Arduino and takes my programming skills to the next level. I bought the robotic arm kit frame which does not even include the servo motors. However, this proved to be a more challenging design and gives me a better satisfaction!

So after coding the Arduino, I have to learn how to connect everything through the breadboard. Dispite having experience in building the Automatic Curtain Opener, this proved to be 10x more complex as it involves a lot more components, and I am so not used to messy wires.

There has been success and failures, including short circuiting the board and ended up burning the entire setup and ended up buying more servos, but the moment when the circuit works and the servos are responding? IT WAS AMAZING!
