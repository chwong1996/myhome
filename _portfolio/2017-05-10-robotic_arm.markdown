Technology is critical for innovation, and innovation is how people, or even the whole human mankind moves forward.  

So after making the automatic curtain opener, what can I do to make something for myself?

A robotic arm. Ta-DA! Fully customizable! The best thing about the robotic arm, with the Arduino is that I can make it do whatever I want, whenever I want! It is like having a dog, but who wants a dog when you can have a robotic arm?

The robotic arm was bought in kits and was coded with the Arduino.

So after that, it is all just about wiring everything up together. It was an absolute mess

The control console is the main stuff, I spent literally 20 mins, including walking to the Design Studio in the University of Southampton, saw through the 6mm MDF board and drilled through the wood with a drill.

This entire thing is cut out from 6mm MDF cardboard and drilled some 10mm holes in it. The potentiometers thus stick out from the board and held in place. How much it costed me to do this? NUTTIN' MATE, not even a penny.

So here it goes! My Robotic Arm!
