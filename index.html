            <h2>About Me</h2>
          </div>
          <p>I'm currently studying in the University of Southampton, doing my third year in civil engineering. I'm an adventurous human being who loves to explore and I love to challenge myself. I like to find my weaknesses and try to overcome them; that is part of the reason why I took up American Football, one of the most violent contact sports in the world; and the major reason for me to pick up programming again. 



My friends define who I am, and luckily I have been influenced by very motivated friends who keep driving me forward and improving myself; so here I would like to express my gratitude to Tunde, Dubai, Ademola and Adib; without them I would never be the same.  </p>
