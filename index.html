            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
          </div>
          <p>I am a civil engineer with a BEng in Civil Engineering. I'm also an adventurous human being who loves to explore and I love to challenge myself. I like to find my weaknesses and try to overcome them; that is part of the reason why I took up American Football, one of the most violent contact sports in the world; and the major reason for me to pick up programming again.

My friends define who I am, and luckily I have been influenced by very motivated friends who keep driving me forward and improving myself; so here I would like to express my gratitude to Tunde, Dubai, Ademola and Adib; without them I would never be the same.  </p>

      <h2>The Key to Everything</h2>
        <p>"The ultimate key to success is learning how to learn." This personal space is about my constant learning, my constant learning, my constant reflecting. After every crucial decision, I console.log it; and make sure I would follow it through. 
        That is how to stay ahead.</p>
